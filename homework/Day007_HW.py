1. JavaScript has no concept of mutable and immutable, but python has mutable and immutable data types.
2. JavaScript should be encoded as UTF-16 as it does not offer any built-in support for manipulating raw bytes.	Python source code is ASCII by default unless you are specifying any encoding format.
3. JavaScript has only floating-point numbers.	In Python, there are many different numeric types like int, fixed-point decimal, etc.
4. JavaScript has fewer modules like date, math, regexp, JSON.	Python includes a wide range of modules.
5. JavaScript helps you to build a website or native application.	Python is for tasks related to data analytics, machine learning, and math-intensive operations.
6. JavaScript objects have properties that can be composed of underlying attributes which let you define a property.	In Python programming language, getter and setter functions are used to defining an attribute.
7. avaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model.	Python uses the class-based inheritance model.

[Disadvantages of JavaScript]
(1)Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. It has been kept for security reasons.
(2)JavaScript can't be used for networking applications because there is not much support available.
(3)JavaScript doesn't have any multiprocessor multithreading features.

[Disadvantages of Python]
As Python is dynamic, so it shows more errors at run-time.
